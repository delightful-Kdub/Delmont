<div class="container about">
  <div class="border">
    <p>Formed in 2013, Delmont began with two men sharing the same passion. While living in Manayunk, Northeast Philadelphia native Sean Ramirez was wanting to break into a new style of music after spending a few years engulfed in a Metalcore band. He invited Joey Fontana, a long time friend who he met while living in Boyertown, to collaborate on a song. After a few hours they realized that with their two styles combined, they made a sound that was classic but totally their own. It was a long road to find a drummer that shared the same passion, patience, and commitment as the original two. But luckily the fates aligned when they found Walt Fisher of Fishtown. The first audition was enough to convince them that Walt embodied all that they needed in a drummer.</p>
    <p>Since then, Delmont has been playing shows all around Pennsylvania. In between shows they have recorded songs at Milkboy Studios in Philadelphia and Everloft Studios in Chalfont. Delmont's first official single Beggar's Son was released in December of 2015. Delmont's sound is ever evolving, but consistently keeping a Classic Rock sound with hints of Jazz and a large influence from Blues. They are working with Everloft in hopes to complete their EP by the end of 2016. Though it has been nearly 3 years in the making, Delmont is hitting their stride and sounding great doing it. This is only the beginning.</p><br/>
